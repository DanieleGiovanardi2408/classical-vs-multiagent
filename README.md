# Classical vs Multi-Agent: Airport Anomaly Detection

**Reply × LUISS — 2026**

## Overview

This project implements the same anomaly detection system twice:
1. **Classical Pipeline** — Feature engineering + IsolationForest/LOF/Z-score + rule-based post-processing
2. **Multi-Agent Architecture** — LLM-powered agents (Data, Baseline, Outlier Detection, Risk Profiling, Report)

The goal is to produce a comparative analysis arguing which approach is more convenient and under what operational conditions.

## Context

Border control authorities and airport operators manage large volumes of passenger transits daily, each associated with rich metadata: timestamp, gate, route, nationality, document type, control outcome, and security alerts.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
